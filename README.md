# YARSS
This is a simple random ship selector inspired by the one made by DInbound
<br/>It's called YARSS for Yet Another Random Ship Selector as there was already one which seems to have been discontinued as the last JSON update was for WoWS 0.7.11

Requires Java to run, you can get that from https://www.java.com/en/download/
